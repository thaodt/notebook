## Recommended technical books
- [Design Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/): A book about the design of data-intensive applications, which is a MUST-read book for software engineers. It covers a wide range of topics, including distributed systems, storage systems, stream processing, batch processing, and so on. It is a book that every software engineer should read. 
    - The plan: reading it 2nd time but this time I do a little different: I will read it in a more "active" way, which means I will take notes and do a mind map for each chapter.
- [OS 3 easy pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/): A book about operating systems, to be honest, I haven't read it yet (just some chapters which Im interested in), but I have heard a lot of good things about it. I will read it after I finish the 1st book "Design Data-Intensive Applications". It's totally free, you can read it online or download the pdf version. But personally I bought a paper version, because I like to read paper books.
- [High Performance Browser Networking](https://hpbn.co/): What every web developer should know about networking and web performance. I have read some chapters, it's a good book. It's also free to read online though.
- [Consistency Models from Jepsen](https://jepsen.io/consistency)

## Movies / Series
- Suits (2011-2019): A series about a law firm, I like it because it's about law, and I like the main character Mike Ross, he is a genius. But the charming man was Harvey Specter, he is a great lawyer, and he is a great mentor. I watched it 2 times, I still didn't finish it at the 1st time, but 2nd one I finished it. I will watch it again in the future.
- Archive 81: A series about a guy who is an archivist, he is hired to restore a collection of damaged videotapes from 1994, he finds himself reconstructing the work of a documentary filmmaker and her investigation into a dangerous cult. I'm still wating for the 2nd season. This series is so amazing and totally different from almost typical series on Netflix.
- The Accountant: A movie about a guy who is an accountant, but he is also a hitman. I like it because it's about accounting, and I like the main character Christian Wolff, he is a genius. 
- The Pianist: 
- The Manifest: it's a series about a plane that disappeared for 5 years, but when it landed, the passengers didn't know that they were missing for 5 years. I like it because it's kind of time-travelling. Besides, we can observe how the passengers' families and friends changed during the 5 years.
- The Good Doctor: it's a series about a doctor who has autism and savant syndrome. The main character is Shaun Murphy, he is a genius and so obsessed with medical.
- The Big Bang Theory: it's a series about 4 scientists and their neighbor. I like it because it's about science.
