# GTK Playround

## [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/)

- Setting up GTK for GNU/Linux and Unix-like systems:
Im using Arch Linux, and I want to use GTK-4, so I installed `gtk4` pkg and the build essentials:
    ```bash
    sudo pacman -S gtk4 base-devel
    ```
- For other distros, please refer to [this page](https://gtk-rs.org/gtk4-rs/git/book/installation_linux.html).
