# Intro
I'm doing some research on how to make a Network Manager plugin in Rust recently. 
I found out that there are not many resources on the internet, so I decided to keep track of what I have learned here.
This journal will be updated as I learn more about Rust and Network Manager, zbus, GTK, etc.
It will be a long and tough journey, but I hope it will be a fruitful one.
